<p>Welcome to Zuppio support central! Zuppio is a Salesforce devops tool with a caveat: everything it can do on one org can be done on hundreds of orgs in one iteration.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Zuppio  works with managed packages’ metadata simplifying the upgrade flow of a managed package - upgrade package versions, update subscriber-editable metadata and more, en masse.</li>
    <li>connect Zuppio to your github or bitbucket and make it a part of your CI/CD pipeline: set up webhooks and trigger deploys on commit</li>
</ul>

<p>Here you can log a case and our team will take care of it. For any other questions don’t hesitate to reach out at const@zupp.io or via contact form on our website!</p>
